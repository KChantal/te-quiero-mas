# Te Quiero MÃ¡s

- Very simple Next.js & TypeScript app that uses Supabase, and displays a card showing 'I love you' in multiple languages
- User has the option to add a new language to the db (a current To Do) - functionality very simple, and request expects a specific format
- Requires extension of error handling (and checking correct translation)
